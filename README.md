# Ansible Post OOD VM

## Introduction

An ansible role to do few things to an OnDemand VM after Open OnDemand is installed. Things like
configure/reconfigure apache with a new authentication configuration.

Things that have to happen _after_ OOD has been installed.


Used to prep a VM in GCP, so there likely are a few Google-isms in there and isn't completely
generic.
